Fake News Detection using Machine Learning  This project implements a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. Using a dataset of real and fake news, the model applies text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a given article is FAKE or REAL.
